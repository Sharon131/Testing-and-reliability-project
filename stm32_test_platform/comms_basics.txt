The communication occurs over a 9600 bps UART in 8N1 mode.
After startup the board displays the following message: "STM32 TEST PLATFORM BOOTUP\n"

List of currently available commands:
> "ok." - used to check the communication with the test platform board; 
response: "OK\n"

> "id01." - used to request the contents of WHO_AM_I register on icm20948.
response: "OK\nX\n", where X is either 1 (correct ID) or 0 (incorrect ID - maybe too fast data transmission or the default value was changed)

> "id." - used to request the contents of WHO_AM_I register on icm20948.
response: "OK\n0xX\n", where X is the ICM20948 ID

> "freq:X." - used to set the MCU core clock frequency HCLK from predefined values. X may be from within the range of 1 to 80 in steps of 1, meaning core frequency of 1 MHz to 80 MHz.
response: "OK\n", but only after a successful core clock frequency change.
note: the SPI interface used to communicate with icm20948 sensor is clocked at HCLK/2.


note: after a new CubeMX (CubeIDE 1.10.0) code generation there will be errors regarding constants names. Consult the original files and fix errors appropriately.

Designed to work with NUCLEO stm32 developement board running a STM32L476RG MCU.
